# Structs and Classes Lab - 2


## Question 1

Using the Room struct below, write code that demonstrates that it is a value type.

```swift
struct Room {
     let maxOccupancy: Int
     let length: Double
     let width: Double
}
```
```swift
//
//struct Room {
//    let maxOccupancy: Int
//    let length: Double
//    let width: Double
//}
//
//var mikesRoom = Room(maxOccupancy: 10, length: 50.6, width: 100.2)
//let mikesSistersRoom = mikesRoom
//
//
//mikesRoom = Room(maxOccupancy: 40, length: 10.4, width: 2.2)
//print(mikesRoom)
//print(mikesSistersRoom)

```

## Question 2

Using the Bike class below, write code that demonstrates that it is a reference type.

```swift
class Bike {
    var wheelNumber = 2
    var hasBell = false
}
```
## Question 3

a. Given the Animal class below, create a Bird subclass with a new `canFly` property.
```swift
class Animal {
var name: String = ""
init (name:String){
self.name = name
}
func printDescription() {
print("I am an animal named \(name)")
}
}

class Bird: Animal {
var canFly: Bool

init (canFly:Bool, birdName:String) {
self.canFly = canFly
super.init(name: birdName)
}

}

let newamnimal = Bird(canFly: true, birdName: "owl")
newamnimal.name
newamnimal.printDescription()
```
b. Override the printDescription method to have the instance of the Bird object print out its name and whether it can fly
```swift
class Animal {
var name: String = ""
init (name:String){
self.name = name
}
func printDescription() {
print("I am an animal named \(name)")
}
}

class Bird: Animal {
var canFly: Bool

init (canFly:Bool, birdName:String) {
self.canFly = canFly
super.init(name: birdName)
}
override func printDescription() {
print("I am an animal named \(name) and the result of can the \(name) fly is \(canFly)")
}

}
```


## Question 4

```swift
class Bike {
  let wheelNumber = 2
  let wheelWidth = 1.3
  var hasBell = true
  func ringBell() {
    if hasBell {
      print("Ring!")
    }
  }
}
```
```swift

```
```swift
class Bike {
let wheelNumber = 2
let wheelWidth = 1.3
var hasBell = true
func ringBell() {
if hasBell {
print("Ring!")
}
}
}

class LoudBike:Bike {
override func ringBell() {
print("RING")
}
func ringBellTimes (amountOfTimes: Int) {
for _ in 1...amountOfTimes {
ringBell()
}

}
}
var loudestRing = LoudBike()
loudestRing.ringBellTimes(amountOfTimes: 5)

```

a. Create a `LoudBike` subclass of Bike.  When you call `ringBell` it should ring the bell in all caps.

b. Give `LoudBike` a new method called `ringBell(times:)` that rings the bell a given number of times


## Question 5

```swift
class Shape {
    var name: String { return "This is a generic shape" }
    var area: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the area") }
    var perimeter: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the perimeter") }
}
```

a. Given the `Shape` object above, create a subclass `Square` with a property `sideLength` with a default value of 5.
```swift
//class Square:Shape {
//    var sideLength = 5
//}
```

b. Override the `area` and `perimeter` computed values so it returns the area/perimeter of the square as appropriate

```swift
class Square:Shape {
var sideLength = 5.0

override var area:Double {
get {
return sideLength * sideLength
}
}
override var perimeter: Double{
return  4 * sideLength
}
}
```

c. Override the `name` property of `Square` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Square") and its area and perimeter

```swift
class Square:Shape {
var sideLength = 5.0

override var area:Double {
get {
return sideLength * sideLength
}
}
override var perimeter: Double{
get {
return  4 * sideLength
}
}
override var name: String {
get {
return " The area of a Square is \(area) and its paramter is \(perimeter)"
}
}

}
var a = Square()
print(a.name)
```

d. Create a class `Rectangle` that subclasses from `Shape`.  Give it a `width` property with a default value of 6 and a `height` property with a default value of 4

```swift

class Rectangle:Shape {
var width = 6
var height = 4
}

```


e. Override the `name` property of `Rectangle` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Rectangle") and its area and perimeter.

```swift
class Rectangle:Shape {
var width = 6.0
var height = 4.0

override var area: Double {
get {
return width * height
}
}
override var perimeter: Double {
get {
return width * 2 + height * 2
}
}
override var name: String {
get {
return "The area of a Rectangle is \(area) and its paramter is \(perimeter)"
}
}
}

```

f. (BONUS) What happens when you run the code below?  Explain why.

```swift
var myShapes = [Shape]()

myShapes.append(Square())
myShapes.append(Rectangle())

for shape in myShapes {
    print("This is a \(shape.name) with an area of \(shape.area) and a perimeter of \(shape.perimeter)")
}
```

## Question 6

a. Given the Point object below, complete the `distance` method so that it returns the distance between a given point.

The equation for the distance formula can be found [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html) and is give by:

```swift
let horizontalDistance = pointOneXValue - pointTwoXValue
let verticalDistance = pointOneYValue - pointTwoYValue
let distanceBetweenTwoPoints = sqrt(horizontalDistance * horizontalDistance + verticalDistance * verticalDistance)
```

`sqrt` is a method in Swift that gives the square root.  Make sure to have `import Foundation` or `import UIKit` to use this method.

```swift
struct Point {
    let x: Double
    let y: Double
    func distance(to point: Point) -> Double {
      //Code in your answer here
    }
}

let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 10, y: 10)

print(pointOne.distance(to: pointTwo)) //Prints 14.142135623730951
```
```swift
struct Point {
let x:Double
let y:Double
func distance(to point: Point) -> Double {
let horizontal = self.x - point.x
let vertical = self.y - point.y
return sqrt(horizontal * horizontal - vertical * vertical)
}
}
let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 10, y: 10)

print(pointOne.distance(to: pointTwo)) //Prints 14.142135623730951
```

b. Given the above Point object, and Circle object below, add a `contains` method that returns whether or not a given point is on the circle

```swift
struct Circle {
    let radius: Double
    let center: Point
}

let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let circleOne = Circle(radius: 5, center: pointOne)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 5, y: 0)
let pointThree = Point(x: 4, y: 0)
let pointFour = Point(x: sqrt(12.5), y: sqrt(12.5))
circleOne.contains(pointTwo) //true
circleOne.contains(pointThree) // false
circleOne.contains(pointFour) //true
```

c. Add another method to `Circle` that returns a random point on the circle

Hint: Given the radius of a circle and the x value of a point on the circle, the y value of the point is defined by:

```
âˆš(r^2) - (x^2)
```

```swift
circleOne.contains(circleOne.getRandomPoint()) //Should always be true
```


## Question 7

a. Create a struct called HangmanModel with 3 properties `targetWord: String`, `numberOfIncorrectGuesses: Int` and `guessedLetters: [Character]`.

```swift
struct HangmanModel {
var targetWord:String
var numberOfIncorrectGuesses:Int
var guessedLetters: [Character]
}
```

b. Add a method called `playerWon` that returns whether all of the characters in `targetWord` are in `guessedLetters`

```swift
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","e","o","l"]
model.playerWon //true
```
```swift

struct HangmanModel {
var targetWord:String
var numberOfIncorrectGuesses:Int
var guessedLetters: [Character]


mutating func playerWon () -> Bool{
var result = true
var falseFolder = [Bool]()
for char in guessedLetters {
if targetWord.contains(char) == false {
falseFolder += [false]
}
}
if falseFolder.count > 0 {
self.numberOfIncorrectGuesses = falseFolder.count
result = false
}
return result
}
}


var model = HangmanModel(targetWord: "hello", numberOfIncorrectGuesses: 0, guessedLetters: ["h","e","o","l"])
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","o","o","l"]
model.playerWon() //true
model.numberOfIncorrectGuesses
```
c. Add a method called `printDisplayVersionOfWord` that prints the `targetWord` replacing characters that are not in `guessedLetters` with "\_"

```
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","l"]
model.printDisplayVersionOfWord
//prints h_ll_
```

d. Add a method called `guess(_:)` that takes in a character as input, and updates `guessedLetters` and `numberOfIncorrectGuesses` as appropriate.

```swift
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guess("h")
model.guess("a")
model.guessedLetters // ["h", "a"]
model.numberOfIncorrectGuesses // 1
```

e. Have `guess(_:)` also print out the current display version of the word, the number of incorrect guesses and if the player has won.
